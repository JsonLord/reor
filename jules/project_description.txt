**Project Description**

**Vision**  
Deploy the **reor** project as a FastAPI-based backend on Hugging Face Spaces, focusing exclusively on the backend with no frontend. The backend will expose AI inference capabilities via API endpoints, with AI settings dynamically configurable through a dedicated `/configure` endpoint. The Helmholtz-Blabladot API will remain the central AI integration, with logging implemented to alert on missing `BLABLADOR_API_KEY`.

**Concrete Goals**  
1. **Backend-Only Deployment**: Deploy only the backend component using FastAPI on Hugging Face Spaces.  
2. **Dynamic AI Configuration**: Expose an API endpoint (`/configure`) to update AI settings (e.g., model alias, endpoint URL) from outside the Hugging Face Space.  
3. **AI Integration Preservation**: Maintain integration with the Helmholtz-Blabladot API (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) for AI inference.  
4. **Error Logging**: Log an error at startup and during API requests if `BLABLADOR_API_KEY` is not set.  
5. **API Endpoint Exposure**: Expose inference endpoints (e.g., `/generate`) to allow external AI requests.  

**Future Use Cases**  
- **External AI Service Integration**: Allow third-party applications to use the reor backend for AI generation by calling `/generate` with dynamic model settings.  
- **Configurable AI Workflows**: Enable developers to switch between different AI models or endpoints at runtime via `/configure`.  
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Use logs to monitor missing API keys and track inference behavior.  
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Use the backend as a microservice in larger AI systems, with frontend components developed separately.  

**Potential Integrations**  
- **Hugging Face Spaces Secrets**: Store `BLABLADOR_API_KEY` securely as a Space secret to avoid hardcoding.  
- **Containerized Deployment**: Use a `Containerfile` to define the FastAPI environment, ensuring compatibility with Hugging Face’s infrastructure.  
- **API Gateway**: Integrate with external API gateways or serverless platforms (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints) for scalable access.  
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integrate with logging services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to track errors and performance.  
- **Frontend Integration**: Future frontend (React/Vite) can be connected via the exposed FastAPI endpoints for a full-stack deployment.
