### **Project Description**

#### **Vision**
Deploy a Gradio-based Hugging Face Space app that integrates with an external OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (`helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1`) using the `alias-large` model. The app must maintain its existing language logic while adapting the deployment strategy to expose backend APIs externally for remote management and interaction. The deployment should leverage Docker, with the interface accessible via port `7860`, and APIs forwarded through a proxy to `https://harvesthealth-magnetic-ui.hf.space`.

#### **Concrete Goals**
1. **LLM Integration**: Replace the existing LLM backend with calls to `https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1` using the `alias-large` model.
2. **Secure API Key Handling**: Load the `BLABLADOR_API_KEY` from Hugging Face Space environment variables.
3. **External API Exposure**: Expose backend APIs via `https://harvesthealth-magnetic-ui.hf.space/api` using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Caddy) within the Docker container.
4. **UI Accessibility**: Serve the Gradio interface on port `7860`, ensuring it is accessible via the Hugging Face Space URL.
5. **Deployment Strategy**: Use Docker for consistent deployment, with Gradio as the frontend and a lightweight proxy (FastAPI or Nginx) for API routing.

#### **Future Use Cases**
- Remote management of the app via RESTful APIs.
- Integration with third-party tools or workflows that require programmatic access to the LLM.
- Scalable deployment for AI-powered language tasks (e.g., chat, summarization, translation) using the external LLM endpoint.
- Potential extension to support multiple models or endpoints via configuration.

#### **Potential Integrations**
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: For hosting and managing the app with environment variables and Docker.
- **FastAPI or Nginx**: As a reverse proxy to forward external API requests to the LLM endpoint.
- **Gradio**: For building and serving the interactive UI.
- **External LLM Endpoint**: `https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1` with `alias-large` model.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment, ensuring reproducibility and portability.
- **Caddy or Nginx**: For handling HTTPS and routing traffic to the appropriate services.
