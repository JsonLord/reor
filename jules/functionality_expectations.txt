### **Functionality Expectations of the Application Once Deployed**

1. **LLM Endpoint Integration**  
   - The application must use the OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint at `https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1` with model alias `large`.  
   - The `BLABLADOR_API_KEY` must be securely retrieved from Hugging Face Space environment variables.

2. **Backend API Exposure**  
   - The backend APIs must be exposed externally via the URL `https://harvesthealth-magnetic-ui.hf.space` to allow remote management and interaction.  
   - A forwarding/proxy system (e.g., Nginx or Caddy) must be implemented to route external API traffic to the backend.

3. **UI Interface**  
   - The frontend interface must be accessible on port `7860` (default for Gradio/Streamlit).  
   - The UI should retain the original language logic and functionality of the source application.

4. **Deployment Strategy**  
   - The application must be deployed using Docker on Hugging Face Spaces.  
   - The deployment should leverage Gradio or Streamlit for the UI, with FastAPI or similar for backend API proxying.

5. **Security & Configuration**  
   - The `BLABLADOR_API_KEY` must be injected securely via Hugging Face Space secrets and not hardcoded.  
   - The application must handle authentication and authorization for API endpoints as needed.

6. **External Accessibility**  
   - The deployed app must be reachable from outside the Hugging Face Space environment via the provided URL.  
   - The `/api` endpoint must be functional and accessible for external clients.

7. **AI-Centric Features**  
   - The core AI functionality (e.g., language processing, prompt handling) must be preserved and optimized for the new LLM endpoint.  
   - The app should support real-time interaction with the LLM via the exposed APIs.

8. **Testing & Validation**  
   - The application must be tested locally and in the Hugging Face Space environment to confirm:  
     - Successful LLM calls using the external endpoint.  
     - Correct loading of environment variables.  
     - Proper API forwarding and external accessibility.  
     - UI responsiveness and functionality.
