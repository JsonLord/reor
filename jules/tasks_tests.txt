1. Estimation of Project Scope from 1-10 and with a presentation of the core parts  
   Scope Estimation: 7/10  
   Core Parts:  
   - Backend server from reorproject/reor.git (to be deployed without frontend)  
   - API exposure for all backend functionalities  
   - Integration with OpenAI-compatible AI endpoint: https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1  
   - Use of model alias "large" and environment variable BLABLADOR_API_KEY  
   - Logging mechanism to indicate if API key is missing  
   - Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with containerized execution  

2. Project Description w/ vision for the project, concrete goals what it should be capable of, and future use cases, and future integrations into other projects  
   Vision: Deploy the reor backend as a standalone, API-accessible service on Hugging Face Spaces to enable programmatic access to its core functionalities with integrated AI capabilities via a secure, external endpoint.  
   Concrete Goals:  
   - Run the reor backend in a container on Hugging Face Spaces  
   - Expose all backend functions via API endpoints (e.g., FastAPI or Gradio-based)  
   - Integrate AI inference using the Helmholtz Blablador endpoint with model alias-large  
   - Securely manage API key via environment variable BLABLADOR_API_KEY  
   - Log startup-time warnings if BLABLADOR_API_KEY is not set  
   Future Use Cases:  
   - Serve as backend for future frontend interfaces or mobile apps  
   - Enable third-party integrations via API  
   - Support AI-augmented data processing workflows  
   Future Integrations:  
   - Integration with Hugging Face Hub models or datasets  
   - Chaining with other Spaces via API calls  
   - Inclusion in larger research or data analysis pipelines  

3. Other Projects or api endpoints that will be integrated into the project to act as part components to the overall project  
   - OpenAI-compatible API endpoint: https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1  
     - Function: AI inference using model alias "large"  
     - Authentication: Bearer token via BLABLADOR_API_KEY environment variable  
   - Hugging Face Spaces platform:  
     - Deployment target with GPU/storage constraints  
     - Secret management for BLABLADOR_API_KEY  
     - Logging interface for container output monitoring  

4. A list of components that need to be built and how they interact  
   - Backend Server (reor core): Executes main logic, potentially needs API wrapper  
   - API Layer: Exposes backend functions via HTTP endpoints (FastAPI or Gradio)  
   - AI Client Module: Communicates with https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1  
   - Environment & Security Handler: Checks for BLABLADOR_API_KEY at startup  
   - Logging Module: Outputs status and warnings (especially missing token)  
   - Docker Container: Packages app for Hugging Face Spaces deployment  
   Interactions:  
   - API Layer receives requests → routes to Backend Server  
   - Backend Server uses AI Client Module when AI inference is needed  
   - AI Client reads BLABLADOR_API_KEY from env, fails gracefully if missing  
   - Environment & Security Handler checks key at startup → logs warning if absent  
   - All logs are visible in Hugging Face container logs  

4.2. A list of subtasks per components. For new coding this means some architecture protocol for security, functionality, and interaction endpoints to other components  
   For the integration of external code for a component: The cloning or lookup of the api documentation, then the investigation for integration, looking up build-protocol, interaction possibilities with the other components, and a judgement on whether it can be integrated as it is, or just parts of it, or whether inidivual code should be mirroring the functionality  
   If the full code shluld serve the purpose, notify the user about it.  

   - Backend Server:  
     - Investigate repo structure: identify entry point (main.py/server.py/app.py)  
     - Determine if existing API framework is used (FastAPI, Flask, etc.)  
     - If no API layer: wrap core functions in FastAPI app  
     - If API exists: extend to expose all required endpoints  
     - Notify: Full backend code from reor.git serves the purpose, but may need API exposure layer  

   - API Layer:  
     - If not present: create FastAPI app with /health, /infer, and relevant endpoints  
     - Define POST/GET routes matching backend functions  
     - Ensure CORS is configured for external access  
     - Return JSON responses with status and data  

   - AI Client Module:  
     - Clone OpenAI-compatible API documentation from https://api.helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/v1  
     - Investigate model alias usage and request format (prompt, max_tokens, etc.)  
     - Implement HTTP client (e.g., using requests or httpx) to send inference requests  
     - Use environment variable BLABLADOR_API_KEY for Authorization header  
     - Build protocol: use async if possible, add timeout and retry logic  
     - Interaction: called by backend when AI inference is needed  
     - Judgement: individual code should mirror OpenAI client pattern but point to Blablador endpoint  

   - Environment & Security Handler:  
     - At application startup, check os.environ.get("BLABLADOR_API_KEY")  
     - If not present, log clear warning: "BLABLADOR_API_KEY not set in environment"  
     - Allow app to start but disable AI features or return 503 if key is missing  

   - Logging Module:  
     - Use Python logging to output to stdout  
     - Ensure warning about missing key is visible in Hugging Face logs  
     - Include timestamps and log levels  

   - Docker Container:  
     - Check for existing Dockerfile in repo  
     - If none: create one based on python:3.10-slim or similar  
     - Install dependencies from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml  
     - Expose port 7860 (default for HF Spaces)  
     - Set CMD to run the API server  
     - Ensure logs are written to stdout for HF monitoring  

4.3. A list of tests to be run per component to check it's working, without writing code, but describing the functionality that should be working and define a success.  
   - Backend Server:  
     - Test: Backend starts without crashing  
     - Success: Process runs and listens on port 7860  
   - API Layer:  
     - Test: Send GET to /health  
     - Success: Returns {"status": "ok", "ai_key_set": true/false}  
   - AI Client Module:  
     - Test: Send valid prompt to /infer endpoint  
     - Success: Returns non-empty response from Blablador API within 30s  
   - Environment & Security Handler:  
     - Test: Run container without BLABLADOR_API_KEY  
     - Success: Log contains warning "BLABLADOR_API_KEY not set"  
   - Logging Module:  
     - Test: Check container logs during startup  
     - Success: Logs show startup message and key status  
   - Docker Container:  
     - Test: Build and run locally with docker run  
     - Success: Server accessible at http://localhost:7860  

5. Task of Full Pipeline Test: A test description for the full interaction from input to output, without writing code, but determining hw success would look like, and write some mock-up input data to use for testing  
   Full Pipeline Test:  
   - Input: POST to /process with JSON: {"text": "Explain quantum computing"}  
   - Flow: API receives → backend processes → detects need for AI → calls Blablador API with model_alias="large" → returns generated text  
   - Success Criteria:  
     - Returns 200 OK  
     - Response contains {"result": "generated text about quantum computing..."}  
     - End-to-end time < 45 seconds  
     - No errors in logs  
   - Mock-up Input: {"text": "What is the capital of France?"}  
   - Expected Output: {"result": "The capital of France is Paris."}  

6. Task of API: Based on API logs documentation, add api endpoints for all functioanlities to be tested later via api request to the app, e.g. gradio endpoint ot fast api. Remember that the full application will be hosted on huggingface based on the parameters provided. fastapis need to be forwarded to the url based on accroding documentation. with a reference to the deployment/huggingface_interactions file.  
   - Add FastAPI endpoints:  
     - GET /health → returns service status and AI key presence  
     - POST /infer → accepts {"prompt": "...", "max_tokens": 100} → returns AI response  
     - POST /process → generic endpoint for backend processing (routes to AI if needed)  
   - Use FastAPI to generate OpenAPI docs (Swagger UI) at /docs  
   - Ensure all endpoints are reachable via Hugging Face Space URL: https://[username]-[repo].hf.space  
   - Forward FastAPI to port 7860 (default for HF Spaces)  
   - Reference: deployment/huggingface_interactions.md for deployment scripts and secret setup  

7. Task of Monitoring: Monitoring of Deployment Process and editing files based on log monitoring until it is successfully deployed and running in its huggingface space, and all functioanlity is working.  
   - Monitor Hugging Face Space build
